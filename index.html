        Kenya, located in East Africa, is known for its stunning landscapes, ranging from the savannas 
        of the Maasai Mara to the coastal beaches along the Indian Ocean. With a population of over 
        52 million, it is a culturally diverse nation with numerous ethnic groups and languages, including 
        Swahili and English. Kenya’s economy is driven by agriculture, tourism, and services, making it a 
        key player in the region. The country gained independence from British colonial rule in 1963 and 
        has since developed into a significant political and economic hub in East Africa.
